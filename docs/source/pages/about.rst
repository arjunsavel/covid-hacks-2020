About covid-19-simulations
############
We're seeking to explore problems related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While an agents-based approach limited by computational tractability will be inherently inaccurate to some degree, we hope that we may be able to gain intuition for questions such as:

- How effective are lockdowns at different points in the spread of disease?
- To what extent might we be under-reporting cases?
- Does quarantining at-risk individuals exclusively for a period of time reduce overall harm?
